### Release Notes
* TWRP now boots, decryption is working fine but aren't tested in GSI.
* Necessary blobs used here are from this OTA Firmware Dump: [RMX3301_11.C.13_1130_202301091837](https://gitlab.com/firmware-dump/android_dump_oplus_RMX3301).
* It was tested in a device running RUI 4.0 (RMX3301_11.C.13) firmware, but it should work in RUI3.0 too.
* Do not flash OTA firmware yet, it is not well-tested, could brick your device.
* Realme GT2 Pro is Virtual A/B with dedicated Recovery Partition, no need to `boot` it like other A/Bs, just `flash` it.

### Working Features
* Internal Storage
* FastbootD
* ADB Commands and Terminal
* Flashing .zip files like magisk and recovery.
* Flashing non-logical .img files.
* ADB Sideload
* MTP

### Issues and Bugs
* External Storage (...tester don't own OTG, can't check.)
* Flashing OTA.
* Backup/Restore (...backup actually works, but restoring it not yet tested.)
* Vibration/Haptics
